# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design


### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
<p> DriverPass realized that many driving students were failing their drivers tests and saw a need in the industry to provide these students with the resources needed to help them succeed. Driver pass is looking to provide a solution to driving students that will provide them with the most current and up to date resources and materials available to help them pass thier drivers tests. DriverPass is looking to implement a could based applicaon where users can access the application and thier materials wherever they have internet accesss. Users will need to be able to create a user profile, select from a variety of packages, schedule and modify appointments for hands on driving instruction as well as make payments using the applicaiton. Users will also need to be able to access their study materials and take practice exams that are congruent with the DMV's most up to date curricculm and policies. </p>
