# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design


### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
<p> DriverPass realized that many driving students were failing their drivers tests and saw a need in the industry to provide these students with the resources needed to help them succeed. Driver pass is looking to provide a solution to driving students that will provide them with the most current and up to date resources and materials available to help them pass thier drivers tests. DriverPass is looking to implement a could based applicaon where users can access the application and thier materials wherever they have internet accesss. Users will need to be able to create a user profile, select from a variety of packages, schedule and modify appointments for hands on driving instruction as well as make payments using the applicaiton. Users will also need to be able to access their study materials and take practice exams that are congruent with the DMV's most up to date curricculm and policies. </p>

### What did you do particularly well?
<p> I beleive for this project I was able to determine the users needs based on the informaiton given and provide the client with the well formed beginning stages of a system design that will meet the clients needs. </p>

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
<p> Given the chance I would like to go back and provide more details to the business and system design documents. The more details you can provide in these documents the more clearly you can define the requirements and solutions you are providing. </p>

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
<p> To gather the users needs we had a sit down with several users from DriverPass where they could explain what they were looking to accomplish with their application and we could then in turn ask clairifying quesitons. We could then break the needs expressed to us by the users into smaller bite sized user stories that could then be assigned to or picked up by team members. It is essential to gather as much information as possible about what the users needs are from the system as well as making sure those needs are as clear as possible when it comes to design and function. This will ensure that we are delivering a system that will satisy the customer as well as ensuring that we will not need to unnecessarily revist aspects of the system because we had to guess at what the user truly wanted.  </p>

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
<p> I liked the sit down approach taken for this project. I think it gives the cleint the opportunity to be very clear on what they need from their system as well as giving the design team the opportunity to follow up and ask clariifying quesitons. I can also see the benefit of employing other tools such as questionairs and group sessions with users. Overall I am a fan of any tool that can help gather the most complete and clear requiremtns from the client as possible and I will use any means that will provide them. </p>
